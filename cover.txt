Dear Visitor,
 
I'm a passionate problem-solver, driven by my love of technology and fueled by my neurodivergence. It gives me a unique perspective that allows me to think creatively and find better solutions.  In my 20+ years of experience, I've honed my skills in infrastructure management, agile delivery, and applied AI.
 
Early in my career, I oversaw infrastructure for 10,000 users across Latin America.  Later, I successfully migrated a complex datacenter to Microsoft Office 365. This showcases my ability to navigate technical challenges on a large scale.
 
Drawn to efficiency, I've excelled in agile environments. As a Scrum Master, I led a 50-developer team to deliver 400 features annually with exceptional success rates. Later, as Release Train Engineer, I streamlined processes for 250 developers and 11 Scrum Masters, demonstrating my ability to optimize complex workflows.
 
Now, I'm eager to focus on software development. My background in AI, ML, and the Power Platform, combined with my neurodivergent strength in problem-solving, will make me a valuable asset to your team.  I'm also a strong communicator, negotiator, and collaborator, ready to thrive in a dynamic environment.
 
I'd love to discuss how my skills and unique perspective could contribute to your company's goals. 
Have a wonderful rest of the day.
 
Sincerely,
