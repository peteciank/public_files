Dear Jane Doe,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration regarding the recent experience I had with your company. On March 25, 2024, I made a purchase of a laptop through your online store. Unfortunately, the experience did not meet my expectations, and I feel compelled to bring it to your attention.

The laptop I received was not as described on your website. The specifications listed online did not match the product I received. Additionally, the laptop arrived with a damaged screen, making it unusable out of the box.

Furthermore, due to the delay in receiving the product and the subsequent return process, I was left without a functioning laptop for an extended period, resulting in significant inconvenience as I rely on it for work and personal use.

I had hoped for better from ABC Company, especially considering your reputation for quality products and excellent customer service. However, based on this encounter, I am left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied.

In light of the above, I would appreciate a full refund for the laptop purchase and reimbursement for any associated expenses incurred during the return process. Additionally, I urge you to take steps to ensure product quality control and improve your shipping and handling procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter further and to reach a satisfactory resolution. You can reach me at (123) 456-7890 or via email at example@email.com.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

John Doe
